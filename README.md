# Magic Squares
This is a 3x3 magic square generator.
The numbers 1 to 9 are shuffled within an array and then placed into a 3x3 matrix (2D array).
If each row and column add up to the same value (15) then it is identified as a magic square.
The code repeats until a magic square is found.
Diagonals are not yet included.
